# Hello Website (blank) -> To not so blank !

This is -> was a basic static HTML starter project you can build on however you like. No need to save. While you develop your site, your changes will happen ðŸª„ immediately in the preview window. You can upload assets like images or audio in `assets` to the left. The rest is up to you and your imagination.
